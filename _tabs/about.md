# Hello! I'm Arnold Aijuka

I am a passionate **Data and Software Developer** enthusiast with a focus on building real-world solutions and bridging the gap between complex data and actionable insights. Currently pursuing my **Master’s degree**, I specialize in leveraging data science concepts to develop insights on real-world problems.

###  What I Do

* **Machine Learning & NLP:** I have deep experience building models using **Python**, **TensorFlow**, and **BERT**, with a specific research focus on **phishing detection**.
* **Data Analysis & Visualization:** I transform raw data into compelling narratives using tools like **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly**, and **Power BI** for business intelligence dashboards.
* **Software Development:** Beyond the backend, I have a keen eye for front-end experiences, enjoying the creation of interactive interfaces and complex web animations.

###  Tech Stack

| Domain | Tools & Technologies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Languages** | Python, JavaScript, SQL, Android Java, SQLite, Flutter, React |
| **Data Science** | Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras |
| **Visualization** | Power BI, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, Tablue |
| **Web Dev** | HTML/CSS, Front-end Animations, Jekyll, Django, React/React Native |

###  Current Focus

I am currently exploring the intersection of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Cybersecurity**, working on thesis-level research to detect sophisticated social engineering attacks. My goal is to develop robust, data-driven applications that not only analyze information but also actively protect users in the digital space.

## Current Projects
### **Sign Language Interpreter**
* **Tech Stack:** TensorFlow Lite, Android Java, Firebase
* Designed a tool for translating American Sign Language into text.

### **Task Management System**
* **Tech Stack:** React.js, Node.js
* Collaborated and built a task management system that tracks the progress of tasks entered by users.

### **Netflix Data Wrangling Project**
* **Tech Stack:** Python (Pandas)
* A Kaggle notebook project mainly focused on structuring and cleaning Netflix TV shows and Movies data.

### **MotyBooks**
* **Tech Stack:** React, Supabase, Netlify
* An online E-bookstore application featuring a variety of readable books.

### **Hockey Web Scraping Project**
* **Tech Stack:** Python (BeautifulSoup, Pandas)
* A web scraping project to retrieve hockey player data and save the scraped information into a CSV file.

### **Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis**
* **Tech Stack:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* A Kaggle notebook demonstrating the process of digging into a dataset to reveal insights and patterns.
